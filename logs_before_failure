summary:     Corrected a small bug for open bc. See the preconds and matrix_operation (Funk) for changes. When an open boundary is on the left for exemple, the bc is u1=(4u2-u3)/3. If mask(3,j)=0, the problem is that u3=0 and u1=4/3u2. This leads to velocities larger than the freedrift when this occurs. The mask should be built  such that it does not occur. The code now has the condition that if mask(3,j)=0, u1=u2 (1st order accuracy).

summary:     Following some tests (p. 30, EC-4), the solver is more robust if the linesearch is applied after a certain nb of Newton iterations (klinesearch): this allows the residual to go up hill at the beginning and later find the 0 with the linesearch (if needed).

summary:     Longuer sims have shown that there are still some failures. I realized there was something inconsistent in my definition of eta at the node. I was using P at the tracer ptn instead of at the node. Now, the deformations are calculated correctly at the node but I do an average (spreading) of P to get P at the node. This is however not second order accurate. I think what I will have to do is to get the stress directly at the node...check this out. So this is just a temporary commit until I find the solution

summary:     Changes to stepper. I had changed before the linearization of the viscous coeff for the Picard solver. When using uk1 (uice) to linearize, the solver is faster but less robust. Over a 2 month run (15 min time step, dx=40km), there are 192 failures with this approach while there are only 14 when linearizing with ul = (uk1+uk2)/2. I therefore set it back to ul

This way with Deltat=30 min for exemple, the first tstep to be calculated is at 1990 01 01 30 instead as what it was before where we had to write 1990 01 01 30 as the starting date. It was confusing as we had to take into account the time step in the input file.

summary:     I have made some modifs: 1) nb of tracers goes from 10 to 2 (could be changed later). This is to reduce the memory. 2) img (restart value) goes from 20 to 50. After discussion with Dana, it looks like the convergence problem we have sometime with fgmres could be due to the use of restart. The max nb of ite in prep_fgmres and prep_fgmre_NK is then set to 50. 3) removed the stop in stepper if JFNK does not converge (there is a print statement) and removed the stop in prep_fgmres and prep_fgmre_NK.

summary:     Allowed time steps are now: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 hours. The winds are temporally linearly interpolated from the 6 hour geostrophic winds derived from the 6 hour NCEP/NCAR slp data. Because of the options for time step, the thermo is now calculated at 12h (after the 12h dynamic and advection calculations) instead of after 6h like it was before with the only available 6 hour time step. The code now ask the user to provide posttimes not only postdates.
