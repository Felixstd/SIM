# TODO List


1. Need to add initial conditions for mu-phi in ini_get. 
	Now, I seem to get infinities in the calculation which may be caused by that.
I need to output the pressure of the VP calculations.  

2. Periodic Boundary Conditions for the mu(I) - Phi(I) variables? 
	Need to look at what is done for pressure. 


3. Should put calculations near stress_strain
