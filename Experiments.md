# Experiments
This file lists the different experiments made using the $\mu(I) - \Phi(I)$ rheology in the McGill SIM model. 

## 03
This was made as initial conditions for the mu-phi rheology tests. It's only a day worth of simulations with 
the VP rheology. 

### What I learned
For the small test that I'm doing, the computations seems not to be stable for a long time but I'm able to
still compute some stuff. This was made with the following parameters
- d_average  = 10             ! Average floe size
- mu_0       = 2.6d-01        ! Static friction coefficient 
- mu_infty   = 4.93           ! free parameter depends on material properties
- c_phi      = 5.3d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties
- I_0        = 2.5d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties



## 04
### Why
This was made to test wether the $\mu(I)$ coefficient is correctly computed. It was not made with as an ideal experiments.

- mu_infty   = 4.93           ! free parameter depends on material properties
- c_phi      = 5.3d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties
- I_0        = 2.5d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties

### What I learned
For the small test that I'm doing, the computations seems not to be stable for a long time but I'm able to
still compute some stuff. This was made with the following parameters (which are almost the same as 04 but I_0 has changed)
- d_average  = 10             ! Average floe size
- mu_0       = 2.6d-01        ! Static friction coefficient 
- mu_infty   = 4.93           ! free parameter depends on material properties
- c_phi      = 5.3d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties
- I_0        = 6.8d-03         ! free parameter depends on material properties

## 08 
I changed the parameters to 
- d_average  = 100            ! Average floe size
- mu_0       = 2.6d-01        ! Static friction coefficient 
- mu_infty   = 4.93           ! free parameter depends on material properties
- c_phi      = 5.3d-01        ! free parameter depends on material properties
- I_0        = 6.8d-03         ! free parameter depends on material properties
