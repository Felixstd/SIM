Every experiment used:
- Nx, Ny = 400, 1000
- Dx = 500
- Asymptotic Ramp up wind with Tramp = 10 up to 10m/s

Initially, 

for Ny > 500:
    h = 10

for Ny < 500:
    h = 1
    Nx < 100 and Nx > 300:
        h = 0
        A = 0




The following experiments have a piece of ice on top of the other one. 

gamma_nl = 1e-3


## Experiment 91
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 1d-01   
    - mu_b       = 9d-01
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.5
