## Experiment 61
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 9d-01
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.1

    We can clearly see some leads forming at the bottom of the ice pack. There is a lot of secondary fractures also. But, it's not breaking at the top. 

## Experiment 62
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 4d-01
    - mu_infty = 5d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 9d-01
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.5

    Now, for the same forcing, but not the same time step (convergence), the ice is not breaking. Changing the mu seems to have make the ice more robuts. Now, most of the ice is 
    in the quasi-static regime. 


## Experiment 63
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 1d-01
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.1

    now it breaks at the top. But, this is not agreeing with the condition: mu_b > 1-7mu/6


## Experiment 64
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 1
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.1

    We can clearly see some leads forming at the bottom of the ice pack. There is a lot of secondary fractures also. But, it's not breaking at the top. But, there seems to be less than for 0.9

## Experiment 65
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 5
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.5

    Again, the ice seems to have more robustness to it. It doesnt break as much as before. 



## Experiment 66
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 4d-01
    - mu_infty = 5d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 5
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.5

    Again, the ice seems to have more robustness to it. It doesnt break as much as before. 

## Experiment 67
    This is the base experiment. This was made with the following parameters:
    - d_average  = 1d03
    - mu_0 = 1d-01
    - mu_infty = 9d-01
    - I_0        = 5d-03      
    -  mu_b       = 10
    - Phi_0      = 1
    - c_phi      = 1
    - Dt = 0.5

    Again, the ice seems to have more robustness to it. It doesnt break as much as before. But with a rampup up to 50 m/s.
