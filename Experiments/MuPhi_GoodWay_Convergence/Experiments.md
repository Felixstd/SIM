## Experiments

Those are the experiments with the mu-phi rheology and the continuity equation for the concentration. 

For all of the experiments:
- No IMEX
- Delta_x = 1km
- Delta_t = 0.1s
- P* = 27.5e3
- tanh() wind ramp-up with Tramp = 60*60*10 up to 10m/s

## Experiment 1
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 1d-01
      mu_infty = 9d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      Base experiment. Here, I obtain some secondary fracture lines

## Experiment 2
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 3d-01
      mu_infty = 9d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      By increasing mu_0, I lose the secondary lines and I keep only two main fracture lines. 

## Experiment 3
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0       = 3d-01
      mu_infty   = 9d-01
      I_0        = 1e-1
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

## Experiment 4
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0       = 3d-01
      mu_infty   = 9d-01
      I_0        = 1e-7
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1
      By really diminishing I_0, I obtain more points in the dense and collisional regime, but I get less fractures? 

## Experiment 5
      d_average  = 1d-03
      mu_0 = 3d-01
      mu_infty = 9d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      Don't get anyting good. 

## Experiment 6
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 1d-01
      mu_infty = 40d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 0.9
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      Weird?????

## Experiment 7
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 1d-01
      mu_infty = 40d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 10
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      Here, the angle seemed to have get bigger. 

## Experiment 8
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 4d-01
      mu_infty = 5d-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 10
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1


      Just not much

## Experiment 9
      d_average  = 1d3
      mu_0 = 4d-01
      mu_infty = 5draw thd-01
      I_0        = 1e-3
      mu_b       = 0.6
      Phi_0      = 1
      c_phi      = 1

      Just not much

Nothing really happening here.

## Experiment 50
THIS WAS MADE WITH THE VP RHEOLOGY
