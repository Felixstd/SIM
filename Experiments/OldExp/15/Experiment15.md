# Experiment 15

This experiment was made with:
- 20 km resolution
-  d_average  = 20d03*7
-  mu_0       = 1.3d-01            
-  mu_infty   = 4.0d-01      
-  c_phi      = 1        
-  I_0        = 6.8d-03                    
-  mu_b       = 7.3d-01
-  Phi_0      = 1
-  Ideal = True
  
with the mu(I)-phi(I) rheology with eta = 0
