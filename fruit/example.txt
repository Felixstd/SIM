Example
=======

By compiling and running the file `fruit_example.f90`, we get the following output::

	.F 
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 Ran 2 tests in 0.000000 seconds.

	 Failed tests:

 	 ### test_my_sum ###
	        Expected: 3.000000
	        Got: 4.000000
	        2+2/=3 !

	 Successful    :              1 / 2
	 Failed        :              1 / 2
	 Success rate:    50.00%


The first line contains a condensed view of the test results: dots (`.`) stand for successes and `F` for failures. In this case, the first test passed and the second one failed. 
Just below, the number of tests is printed with the time it took to execute. Then, for each failure a message is printed indicating the unit from which the failure originates, 
the expected answer, the value that was tested and a user defined message. A résumé of the number of successes and failures is then printed, because it is so gratifying when they 
all pass.
